# Welcome

<p>Welcome to The Drug Rehabilitation Game, an interactive platform helping people battle drug addiction one day at a time.
The first step towards rehabilitation is always the hardest, so first thing’s first, here’s to our fighters… HURRAH!
The game is simple: create a player profile and begin fighting the addiction by completing quests, unlocking tools and even inviting friends or family to help you. These valuable allies can set quests, grant rewards and support you through your rehab journey. You can also support other fighters in the game by offering your aid and becoming their ally also.
This can be a useful tool to help you in your daily struggle against drug addiction and new life development but don’t forget to seek help elsewhere also.
Drug addiction is real and debilitating just like drug rehabilitation is real and inspiring so join the struggle, battle your enemies and live to fight another day.</p>

## Benefits of the game

This game is a tool that can help many people in the fight against drug addiction whether it be users, affected family and friends or support workers. The features in the Drug Rehab Game help motivate people in recovery by giving them a different platform to achieve results and work with others whilst still operating within the traditional framework of the well-understood 12-step program. The content that players read and engage with has been viewed and approved by professionals working within the rehabilitation field and additionally provides access to many more resources. It is good to remember this is an additional tool to add to the set on the path to recovery.
