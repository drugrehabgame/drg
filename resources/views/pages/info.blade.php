            <p>Substance misuse is the harmful use of drugs or alcohol for non-medical purposes. Often associated with the use of illicit drugs, legal substances can also be misused, such as alcohol, prescription or over-the-counter medication, caffeine, nicotine and volatile substances (e.g. petrol, glue, paint). Most people with a substance use disorder are using alcohol.</p>
            <p>Addiction is a physical and/or psychological need to use a substance, often caused by regular continued use. Some substances are more highly addictive than others. Some people are more likely to become addicted to a substance depending on mental, physical and lifestyle factors.</p>

            <h3>What you can do</h3>

            <p>It is difficult to accept you have a problem and to ask for help. Be honest with yourself and others and get the help and support you need.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Recognise when your substance use has become a problem</b><span> - realising and accepting that you are abusing or addicted to substances is the first step to finding help.</span></li>
                <li><b>Get support</b><span> - getting through this on your own can be difficult. Talk to friends, family, your doctor, other health professionals or a telephone helpline about your substance use.</span></li>
                <li><b>Investigate options for help</b><span> - manage and treat substance misuse and addiction through counselling, medication, rehabilitation centres, self-help programs or support networks. You might need to try a number of options before you find what works for you – it’s important to keep trying.</span></li>
                <li><b>Find alternative coping strategies </b><span>- if you are using substances to cope with life or escape personal problems, find other ways to manage the situation and deal with life’s stress and pressures. By dealing with other problems in your life you can make it easier to recover and not relapse.</span></li>
                <li><b>Deal with setbacks and keep going</b><span> - Recovery can be a long and difficult road. Expect some setbacks and don’t focus on failures, focus on your plan and understand your triggers and how to best respond to them in future.</span></li>
            </ol>
